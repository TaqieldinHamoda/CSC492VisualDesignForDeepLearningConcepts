1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The RNN shown here has been trained to translate from English to Spanish 

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The input sentence is "I Eat Apples". 

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Constructing the encoder's hidden units 

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Constructing the decoder's hidden units 

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The attention vector is calculated 

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Attention uses the previous decoder unit 

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The attention vector provides a weight for each of the encoder's units 

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
These weights are used to calculate the context vector 

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The context vector tells the decoder which hidden units to pay attention to 

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The context vector gives "I" a weight of 0.12, "Eat" a weight of 0.88, and "Apples" a weight of 0.00 

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The context vector is telling the decoder to pay the most attention to "Eat" 

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Using the context vector, the decoder unit is able to determine what to translate 

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It decides to translate the word "Eat" conjugated for the pronoun "I" 

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This results in the Spanish word "Como" 

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The same process is then repeated but for the second decoder unit 

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The attention vector gives "Apples" a weight of 0.99 

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The context vector is paying the most attention to "Apples" 

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The decoder decides to translate the word "Apples" into Spanish 

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This results in the Spanish word "Manzanas"
